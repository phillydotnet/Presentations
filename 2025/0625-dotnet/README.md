## Introduction To GitHub

Lab repository: https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github?tab=readme-ov-file

This lab is automated using GitHub actions, and the workflows are designed to monitor what you are doing in the lab.

Through the lab you will learn how to:
- Fork a repository
- Create a branch in the GitHub web interface
- Add a file to the branch
- Commit changes to the branch
- Create a pull request
- Merge the pull request

## GitHub CodeSpaces Hands-On Lab 
**Presented by Rich Ross**

The slides Rich showed are found at the GitHub Copilot Global Bootcamp. 

Specifically, the slide file is a PowerPoint presentation found here:
https://github.com/microsoft/GitHub-Copilot-Global-Bootcamp/tree/main/content

(CodeSpaces content is slides 9-14 of the PowerPoint file.)

CodeSpaces Examples GitHub organization: https://github.com/codespaces-examples

- Choose a repository here to open an example CodeSpace all ready to go with the tools needed to be a developer in that technology.

- For a DotNet example, try going to this repository that sets up everything you need for .NET Aspire: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-devcontainer

- Devcontainers and devcontainer.json allow you to define the environment you want to work in

- Information about Dev Containers: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container

- Note that you don't **need** a devcontainer.json to use CodeSpaces.  You can create a CodeSpace and launch it from any repository.

## GitHub Copilot
** Presented by Tony Verguldi**
The slides Tony showed are found at the GitHub Copilot Global Bootcamp. 

Specifically, the slide file is a PowerPoint presentation found here:
https://github.com/microsoft/GitHub-Copilot-Global-Bootcamp/tree/main/content

(CodeSpaces content is slides 15-23 of the PowerPoint file.)

You can get started with GitHub Copilot right now by going to:

### Copilot Instructions File
The copilot instructions file allows you to define how you want Copilot to behave in your repository.  This provides you some common instructions for every prompt instead of having to repeat yourself every time you ask Copilot a question.

More information about the copilot instructions file are here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization

### Copilot Models
Comparing the available models for Copilot: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task

### Agent Mode
Agent Mode is a newer feature of GitHub Copilot that goes beyond the chatting about your work.  It can complete tasks for you, such as writing code, running tests, and even deploying applications. This feature is designed to help you be more productive by automating repetitive tasks.
