# The Anatomy of an AI Breach: From Attack to Defense

## [Meetup site](https://www.meetup.com/philly-net/events/305135875/) for this event

### Overview
As AI adoption accelerates, security is becoming one of the most overlooked yet critical challenges. John Iwasz explores common vulnerabilities in AI-powered systems through a live demonstration of a misconfigured MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Attendees will see how attackers can exploit weaknesses in authentication and access control to compromise AI infrastructure. The session then transitions into practical defense strategies, showcasing how OAuth can be implemented to secure MCP endpoints. By the end, participants will gain a deeper understanding of AI system vulnerabilities, the risks of insecure deployments, and concrete steps to harden their environments against real-world threats.
