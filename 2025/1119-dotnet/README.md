## [Meetup site](https://www.meetup.com/philly-net/events/310554338) for this event

### Overview
In this session, we will look at the Microsoft Agent Framework and show how .NET developers can orchestrate multi‑step, tool‑using AI agents with solid grounding, safety, and telemetry. We’ll walk through the core building blocks and how they plug into your existing .NET and Azure AI stack. If you used Semantic Kernel in the past, we will talk about the migration path which is an Agentic DevOps discussion all on its own. Then we’ll go hands‑on to build a small agent end‑to‑end (tool invocation + retrieval + guardrails), so you leave with a working starter you can extend. Bring your questions. Bring your laptops. Bring your curiosity.
