## Azure Functions Tips

- Try to use Azurite for local storage emulation.  The Azure Storage Emulator is Windows only and being deprecated.
- Working locally is great, but test in the cloud to root out issues where you might be relying on the local machine.
- Best Practices from the Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-best-practices?tabs=csharp
