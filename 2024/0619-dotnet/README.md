### Presented by: Brian Minisi

#### Overview
In this workshop, we will build out an Azure Kubernetes Service platform from scratch. Beginning with an overview of microservices and the AKS architecture, we will then create the resources that support the platform which includes, networking, AKS, ACR, and Private DNS Zones. The workshop will also cover building and deploying a service with Key Vault integration.

If you want to follow along, you will need your own Azure subscription with at least contributor access to the subscription or Resource Group. Also, to deploy using pipelines, have your own Azure DevOps team project where you are a project administrator. Also, to create service connections, owner rights in Entra ID or the rights to create service principals is necessary.
