### Presented by: John Sherman

#### Overview
Every major AI CEO signed a 22-word statement in May 2023 saying "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI shouldbe a global priority alongisde other societal scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war." So why isn't anyone acting like it? Nuclear and pandemic threats are both highly regulated fields, led by elected leaders, experts and organizations that are accountable to the public. AI is led by unelected leaders motivated by profit, accountable only to their shareholders. You hear and read all day about all of the amazing things AI is going to do for us. This talk is not that. This is the hardest conversation humans have ever had. The makers of AI openly admit their technology could kill all life on earth, openly admit the technology is not aligned with human goals or values, openly admit they do not understand how it works, openly admit it has the power to cause human extinction, within 1-50 years, and openly admit that they are focusing nearly all of their time and money making it stronger not safer. The greatest, most immediate threat to you and your family is artificial intelligence. Learn why and what you can do about it.
