# Power Platform: PowerApps and PowerBI

## PowerApps
Presented by: James Stento  - Microsoft Principal Technical Architect

Landing page for Power Platform: https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/

Business users who don't know the underlying technical issues with things like (but not limited to) connecting to a database, calling an API, etc... can use connectors to access data in these low-code apps.

[What is Power Platform?](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/what-is-power-platform/)

James: "There aren't nearly enough developers to do what the business needs them to do."
"The folks that execute business processes and require IT services is changing."

### Notes
Power Platform governance controls what people can build, user access control, and preventing users from writing apps they shouldn't.  This is built into the platform.

There are hundreds of standard connectors, but you can build your own custom connectors.

Fusion Teams

Pro IT developers, Business Analysts, 
Bring in the services needed whether existing or custom, exposed to the power platform creators to drive the business.
