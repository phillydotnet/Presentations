## Blazor United: The Future of ASP.NET Core in .NET 8

## Short Link to This Content: https://bit.ly/pdn231101

### Presented by: Chris Gomez

#### Overview
At [dotNetConf](https://www.dotnetconf.net/) on November 14th, we expect .NET 8 to release and ASP.NET Core 8 with it.  One of the major advancements is a set of features that were first previewed to the world as "Blazor United".  This set of features makes Blazor a "Full Stack" framework equally ready for SPA development and Server Side development as well as the spectrum in between.

This talk will go over the new features of ASP.NET Core 8, which actually benefit all ASP.NET developers whether you intend to use Blazor as a framework or not.  You might find that you want to stick with the ASP.NET framework you are using but want to do some light modularization with components.  Maybe you want to keep using your current SPA framework and use components.
