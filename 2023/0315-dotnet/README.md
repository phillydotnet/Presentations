## Understanding Go: Learnings from Microsoft's Ad Tech Platform

### Presented by: Scott Kay - Microsoft Ad Server

#### Overview

Go is an open-source programming language that offers straightforward syntax, fast compilation, built-in concurrency, and a range of tools that makes coding more efficient and fun. As Go continues to gain in popularity, it's becoming an increasingly attractive option for high-performance services. Go is the language of choice among cloud infrastructure products, including Docker and Kubernetes, and is used within Microsoft's Ad Tech platform.

In this talk, you'll see how Go powers parts of Microsoft's Ad Tech platform and learn how to get started developing your own Go application. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this talk will provide insights into Go's capability and familiarize you with its ecosystem.

### Notes

#### Go as an up and coming popular language
Go is a featured language in the Stack Overflow developer technology survey.  While it only accounts for about [11% in terms of popularity](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies), it ranked [8th in the most loved technology category](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted).

#### Getting started
You can start with and try Go right at the Go Language website: https://go.dev/

#### Go at Microsoft
Go is used at Microsoft on Prebid Server: https://github.com/prebid/prebid-server.

Prebid Server is an open source implementation of Server-Side Header Bidding

#### Go and C# Quick Comparison
| Go         | C#|
|--------------|-----------|
| Garbage Collected| Garbage Collected|
| Compile For Anywhere| Run Anywhere|
| Minimalistic Syntax|Expressive Syntax|
|No UI Framework|Strong Ui Framework|
|Open-Source Ecosystem|NuGet & Proprietary|
|Generics**|Generics +|
|Duck Typing + Embedding| Traditional Inheritance|
|Channels + Go Routines|Async|

** Scott pointed out Generics are new to Go and are not as powerful.  Some say they are not necessary or as critical.

By comparison, Go has less syntax, with less keywords than C#.  It is considered quite opinionated in the language itself.

#### Getting started

Common IDE/editors are: Visual Studio Code, GoLand, or a text editor like Vim.

#### A sample first Go program
``` Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

## AI for Developers: Enhancing Skills, Not Replacing Them

### Presented by: Chris Love

#### Overview

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has left many software developers feeling uncertain about the future of their profession. However, the truth is that AI is not here to replace developers, but to help them become even better.

Join us for an insightful exploration of AI-powered tools for software development, including ChatGPT, MidJourney, and GitHub Copilot. In this presentation, we will discuss how these tools can be leveraged to enhance developer skills, increase productivity, and streamline the coding process. 

By working alongside AI, developers can overcome common coding challenges and free up time to focus on more creative and impactful tasks. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this presentation will provide valuable insights on how to use AI to take your development skills to the next level. 

Join us and discover how you can embrace the power of AI and become a better developer in the process.
