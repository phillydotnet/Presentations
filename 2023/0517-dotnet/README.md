## C# Error Handling

### Presented by: Louis Berman

#### Overview
Most of us take an ad-hoc approach to error-handling and logging—a bit of try-catch here, a global error logger there, maybe some code-contracts if we’re willing to put in some extra effort—but there’s a (much) better way. Join Louis Berman as he shows us how his **SquidEyes.Fundamentals** library can help to take our error handling and logging to the next level!
